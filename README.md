# Hermes

A Clojure library designed to make it easy to work with
[Titan](http://thinkaurelius.github.com/titan/). To get
started, add this dependency to your `project.clj`:

``` clojure
[hermes "0.2.7"]
```

Take a look at [the wiki](https://github.com/gameclosure/hermes/wiki)
for information about Hermes and how to use the library. Try the
[Quick Start](https://github.com/gameclosure/hermes/wiki/Quick-Start)
page if you are in the mood for barrelling through an example.

# Youth
Titan is a young project and has just now barely hit 0.2. Hermes will probably
always be a "work in progress" until Titan hits 1.0. With all that in
mind, we've created a solid set of tests that encapsulates everything
we want Hermes to do right now. While we don't know all of the myriad
changes that will for sure come to both Hermes and Titan in the
future, we do know that both pieces of software seem to work as
intended and that we plan on adapting Hermes as quickly as possible to
take advantage of whatever the Titan team puts out.
